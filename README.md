# PokemonInfoApp
This is a code which uses pokeapi.co/api to gather basic information about pokemons. 
After executing the code, a Tkinter window will open, asking you the name of the pokemon to be searched.
After writing the name and pushing the button, you will be given the abilities, base stats and types of the pokemon.
